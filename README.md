# PEC 3

This project contains the code for the evaluation PEC 3 of the  HTML and CSS Tools 2 course from the [Master's Program in Web App and Website Development](https://estudis.uoc.edu/ca/masters-universitaris/desenvolupament-llocs-aplicacions-web/presentacio) at the [Universitat Oberta de Catalunya](https://www.uoc.edu).

In this PEC, I focus on developing a website for a cybersecurity conference organized by students. The website serves as an informational hub for the event, which features expert talks, a programming contest centered on cybersecurity, and other engaging activities.

The site includes a responsive homepage styled with CSS Grid, functioning as a visually appealing poster for the event. Additional pages provide details about the speakers, an article with insights into the conference, and a creative section showcasing advanced design elements, such as interactive galleries or functional forms. The design leverages modern CSS techniques to deliver a polished and user-friendly experience across all devices.

## Requirements

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) >= 18.x

## Getting started

Clone this repository with `git clone`, or download a .zip file using the top right green button.

Using the Terminal, navigate to the project folder and run `npm install`.

## Features

- Uses [Parcel v2](https://parceljs.org) module bundler.
- NPM scripts for fast development and production build (see Commands below).

### Stylesheets

- **Uses [Tailwind v3](https://tailwindcss.com/) CSS framework.**
- [Sass/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) to CSS compilation.
- Minification and optimization of CSS files on production builds with [`cssnano`](https://github.com/cssnano/cssnano) (`@parcel/optimizer-cssnano`).
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) features:
  - Transpile modern CSS with [`postcss-preset-env`](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/features).
  - Automatically add CSS prefix to unsupported properties with [`autoprefixer`](https://autoprefixer.github.io/).

### HTML

- Minification and optimization of CSS files on production builds [`htmlnano`](https://github.com/posthtml/htmlnano) (`@parcel/optimizer-htmlnano`).
- [PostHTML](https://github.com/posthtml/posthtml) features:
  - Include partial HTML files with [`posthtml-include`](https://github.com/posthtml/posthtml-include).

### Scripts

- Allow for modern JavaScript (ES201x/ES8/ES7/ES6â€¦) which is automatically transpiled (for the older browsers set in the `package.json`) and minifed in production builds, with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

### Images

- Image transformation with [`@parcel/transformer-image`](https://parceljs.org/recipes/image/) (based on [`sharp`](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/)).

### Development

- Development server launch and live reloading on file changes.
- Friendly error reporting.

## How to use this application

Content lives inside the `src/` folder. If you do not want to change the configuration or are unsure about what you are doing, do not edit files outside the `src/` folder.

Always run the following commands during the development stage and for production builds. Please note that it is expected that all projects built with this boilerplate are compiled using `npm run build` before they are published.

### Commands

| Command         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`   | Runs a local web server for development and opens the browser to display it. Automatically compiles styles and scripts whenever a file in `src/` is changed, and live reloads the browser. This is what _must be run_ on the development stage.                                                                                                                     |
| `npm run build` | Compiles and minifies and optimizes the files in the assets folder. The generated compiled and optimized files are located in the `dist/` folder. This is what _must be run_ before publishing the project. This is also the build command to be run by external deployment services such as Netlify. The publishable files are then located in the `dist/` folder. |
| `npm run clean` | Deletes the current `/dist` folder and cache folders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `npm run test`  | Displays a success message if everything is working as expected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
